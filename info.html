  <h1>Intro to C++</h1>

  <p>
  	<p><b>    </b> </p>
 “C++ is a statically-typed, free-form, (usually) compiled, multi-paradigm, intermediate-level general-purpose middle-level programming language.”
<p><b>    </b> </p>
In simple terms, C++ is a sophisticated, efficient and a general-purpose programming language based on C. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
Many of today’s operating systems, system drivers, browsers and games use C++ as their core language. This makes C++ one of the most popular languages today.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
Since it is an enhanced/extended version of C programming language, C and C++ are often denoted together as C/C++.
<p><b>    </b> </p>

  	Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original implementer of C++ and the author of Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 2nd Edition and The C++ Programming Language, among others. Having previously worked at Bell Labs, AT&T Labs - Research, and Texas A&M University, he is currently Managing Director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley in New York City. The recipient of numerous honors, including The National Academy of Engineering 2018 Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering “for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language, Dr. Stroustrup is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, an AT&T Fellow, an AT&T Bell Laboratories Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, and an ACM Fellow. He was voted into Electronic Design's Engineering Hall of Fame in 2013. His research interests include distributed systems, simulation, design, programming techniques, software development tools, and programming languages, and he remains actively involved in the ANSI/ISO standardization of C++. Dr. Stroustrup holds an advanced degree from the University of Aarhus in his native Denmark and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cambridge University, England

  <h1>Intro to OS</h1>

  <p>
<p><b>    </b> </p>
  	An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
The dominant desktop operating system is Microsoft Windows with a market share of around 82.74%. macOS by Apple Inc. is in second place (13.23%), and the varieties of Linux are collectively in third place (1.57%). In the mobile (smartphone and tablet combined) sector, use in 2017 is up to 70% of Google's Android and according to third quarter 2016 data, Android on smartphones is dominant with 87.5 percent and a growth rate 10.3 percent per year, followed by Apple's iOS with 12.1 percent and a per year decrease in market share of 5.2 percent, while other operating systems amount to just 0.3 percent. Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications.

  <h1>Intro to Python</h1>

  <p>
<p><b>    </b> </p>
  	Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural. It also has a comprehensive standard library.
<p><b>    </b> </p>
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
